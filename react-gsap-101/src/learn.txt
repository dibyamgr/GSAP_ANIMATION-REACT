How to animate React ref using GSAP

1. gsap.from(refElement.current, {animation properties})

autoAlpha - similar to opacity except that when the value hits 0, 
the visibikity property will be set to 'hidden' in order to improve
browser rendering performance and prevent clicks/interacitivity on the Target


Tween
- manages the shift from one property value to another property value for an object
- abbreviation for "in-between"
- In animation, tweens are the frames to depict a character's or object's motion between key frames.
